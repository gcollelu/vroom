## The Issue

* 30% of the homeless population in Santa Cruz resides in their vehicles. 
* Finding a place to park your car and sleep in it can be hard.
* Most of public parking are patrolled by local police.
* Many people are offering their drive-ways for rent on Craigslist, given the housing crisis in the county.
* Government led programs are scarce and do not fit the demand.

## The Audience
