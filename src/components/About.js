        <ul>
          <li>30% of the homeless population in Santa Cruz resides in their vehicles. </li>
          <li>Finding a place to park your car and sleep in it can be hard.</li>
          <li>Most of public parking are patrolled by local police.</li>
          <li>Many people are offering their drive-ways for rent on Craigslist,
            given the housing crisis in the county.
          </li>
          <li>Government led programs are scarce and do not fit the demand.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="the-audience">The Audience</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Our app is aimed to anyone sleeping in their car or van of preference.</li>
          <li>Our app is also used by those who have driveways, parking lots,
            and other space that are not being used.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="our-solution">Our Solution</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Our goal is to make an app to connect people that have an extra parking space
            they would like to offer with people that need a safe place to park their vehicle
            overnight for a low cost.
          </li>
          <li>By having a centralized app, those residing in their vehicles can easily look
            for a parking spot that they know they will be safe at for any duration that
            spaces are available.
          </li>
        </ul>
